    <h1>What is XML?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage</li>
        <li>XML is a <strong> markup language </strong> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML was designed to <strong> describe data </strong></li>
        <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must <strong> define your own tags </strong></li>
        <li>XML uses a <strong> Document Type Definition </strong> (DTD) or an <strong> XML Schema </strong> to describe <br> the data</li>
        <li>XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to be <strong> self-descriptive </strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h1> The main difference between XML and HTML</h1>
    <h3>XML was designed to carry data.</h3>

    <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML.<br> XML and HTML were designed with different goals: </p>

    <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is.<br> HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p>

    <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.</p>

    <h1>XML does not DO anything</h1>
    <h3>XML was not designed to DO anything.</h3>

    <p>Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created <br>
        to structure, store and to send information.</p>

    <p>The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:</p>

    <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information. <br>
        But still, this XML document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped <br>
        in XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.</p>
